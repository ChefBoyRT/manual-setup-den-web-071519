Congratulations on finishing the pre-work and welcome to the program!

Now, we are going to stop utilizing the LEARN IDE! For this we have specific [guidelines.](http://help.learn.co/workflow-tips/local-environment/mac-osx-manual-environment-set-up)  

**THIS SETUP HAS TO BE COMPLETED IN THE NUMBERED ORDER; NO STEP IS TO BE IGNORED\*.**

_\*Note on STEP 1:_ 
* _If you have been using the Learn IDE that is built into your browser when you visit learn.co: IGNORE STEP 1, it does not apply. Almost everyone will fall into this group._ 
* _If you have a DOWNLOADED version of the Learn IDE that opens up in Atom, follow the instructions in STEP 1_
