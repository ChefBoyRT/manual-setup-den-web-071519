# Manual Setup

Congratulations on finishing the pre-work and welcome to the program!

Now, we are going to stop utilizing the LEARN IDE! For this we have specific [guidelines.](http://help.learn.co/workflow-tips/local-environment/mac-osx-manual-environment-set-up)  

_An additional note on unistalling the Learn IDE:  Open up Atom. At the top of the screen click Atom then click Preferences and then click Packages on the sidebar of the window that opens. If there are any "Installed Packages" that are from Learn, click the trashcan icon to delete them._
    
**THIS SETUP HAS TO BE COMPLETED IN THE NUMBERED ORDER; NO STEP IS TO BE IGNORED.**
